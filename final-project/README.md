# **FP1 \- Proposal for Critique**

## Idea Sketches

### *Idea 1*

![Personal Portfolio](images/ProjectProposal1.png)

This project is designed to create my own Personal Portfolio for my UX & Photography work. The goal is to use this project to jump-start coding my own portfolio, as it’s something I’ve struggled with alongside other designers. This portfolio will be used for subsequent projects and job applications.

I plan on making including animations within this project in order to make it interactive. The use of color will also be implimented in order to not only make the page visually appealing, but create hierarchy as well.

In order to make this design accessible, I'll be adhering to the WCAG guidelines and practices. There are also been talks off adding a day/night mode for contrast variations.


### *Idea 2*

This project is designed to create a platform where users can share and rate outfits and styles.

* By including a rating scale, clickable links and images, the platform comes alive with interactivity.
* In order to make this design accessible, I'll be adhering to the WCAG guidelines and practices. There are also been talks off adding a day/night mode for contrast variations.
### *Idea 3*

This project is designed to create a platform where users can find jobs and go through the recruiting process with greater transparency.

* Users can interact with this platform by clicking on the recommended job postings, viewing the roles they've already submitted, or clicking a link to a connect with a relavant recruiter on LinkedIn.
* In order to make this design accessible, I'll be adhering to the WCAG guidelines and practices. There are also been talks off adding a day/night mode for contrast variations.

## Feedback Summary

### Personal Portfolio
There was feedback concerning the animations. Animations could make the page look distracting and take away from the aesthetics and overall usability in terms of performance. 

### Outfit Rating Platform (OOTD)
With this idea being a platform, the feedback was moreso geared towards social features. One feature that was proposed was to be able to save other people's outfits as inspiration or for moodboards. However in terms of being built, there is a concern with how to upload and save pictures. Buying servers and storage might be outside the scope of this project.

### Recruitment CRM (fairplay)
Trying to create a CRM is not easy. And even less so for jobs application. There will be a lot of connections to different web APIs like LinkedIn and Indeed.

## Feedback Digestion

Based on the feedback I've received, I've chosen to take on the Personal Portfolio as my final project. This project allows me to exercise my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ailities while learning new frameworks like React. There are ways to mitigate animations while keeping performance. I'm excited to take this project onboard and really look forward to the final result!
